# Music-Player
Learning basic string and array methods by building a music player.

I learned some essential string and array methods like the find(), forEach(), map(), and join(). These methods are crucial for developing dynamic web applications.

In this project, I coded a basic MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project covers fundamental concepts such as handling audio playback, managing a playlist, implementing play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle functionalities. I even learned how to dynamically update the user interface based on the current song. Practicing in https://www.freecodecamp.org.
